### Data Sources

- [Shipping Ports Around the World](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjeetsinghnaik/ship-ports) from Kaggle using .csv format

### Deliverable 1 - Design a dimensional data mart that represents a simple business process of your choosing
Our team used the Employees Sample Database, along with Sample Sales Data & Shipping Ports Around the World, to design a dimensional data mart that reflects business operations procedures.

### Deliverable 2 - Develop an ETL pipeline that extracts, transforms, and loads data into your data mart


### Deliverable 3 - Author one or more SQL queries (SELECT statements) to demonstrate proper functionality
