## *Team members: Ryan, Lexi & Caitlin*

### Data Sources 
- [Employees Sample Database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/) from MySQL
- [Sample Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data) from Kaggle pulled using API

### Deliverable 1 - Design a dimensional data mart that represents a simple business process of your choosing
Our team used the Employees Sample Database, along with Sample Sales Data & Shipping Ports Around the World, to design a dimensional data mart that reflects business operations procedures. This reflects interaction between retailers & customers.

### Deliverable 2 - Develop an ETL pipeline that extracts, transforms, and loads data into your data mart
Notes on our process for the ETL pipeline:
- Extracted Employees Sample Database from MySQL
- Retrieved Sample Sales Data & Shipping Ports Around the World to convert into SQL database table
